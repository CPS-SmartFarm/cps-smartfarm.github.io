ABSTRACT="The rapid evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) has underscored the
importance of comprehensive educational strategies to impart IoT concepts
and applications to a diverse audience. Given IoT's pervasive impact, there
is hence a pressing need for effective education in this area. Currently,
there is a significant gap between existing educational strategies for IoT
and the dynamic, engaging approaches needed to captivate a diverse
audience, particularly young learners. The challenge lies in developing a
methodology that not only educates but also motivates students e.g., from
Grade 2 to Grade 12. To address this need, we developed an innovative,
activity-based educational framework, integrating interactive and immersive
learning methods, aimed at simplifying complex IoT concepts with smart
agricultural application in mind for early learners. We outline this novel
pedagogical approach, detailing how specific IoT components are taught
through targeted activities. The paper should serve as a guide for
educators to implement this framework and encourage readers to recognize
the importance of adopting new teaching strategies for IoT. Through the
implementation of this framework, exemplified in a case study of a plant
care game, we have observed an increased engagement and understanding of
IoT concepts among our target students. These findings indicate the
effectiveness of our approach in real-world educational settings."
