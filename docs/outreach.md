Our commitment to community engagement and educational outreach is a vital part of our mission. In Spring 2023, we actively participated in multiple rounds of iSCORE on the SLU campus, a program dedicated to expanding STEM education for PreK-12 and K-12 students, all thanks to the visionary leadership of Dr. Christa Jackson. To address the security aspects of our project, we've crafted interactive game-based activities designed to teach cryptographic concepts, including zero-knowledge proofs, to young students in the first, second, and third grades.

Furthermore, from March to August, one of our postdoctoral fellows provided valuable mentorship to three members of the Remote Sensing Laboratory â€“ a master's student, a PhD student, and a postdoctoral researcher. This mentorship covered a wide array of topics, including clustering algorithms, image georeferencing using Python, and machine learning. We are proud to contribute to the growth and development of the next generation of STEM enthusiasts and researchers.
